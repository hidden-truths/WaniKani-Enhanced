# 独り言 Self-Talk — output/speaking-practice tab

The **source of truth for the Self-Talk surface** — the 5th tab in the study app. Where the rest
of the app trains *recognition* (flashcards, Browse, Minna), Self-Talk is **output reps**: a running
daily monologue you read aloud, hear, record, and compare to a reference voice. Built for N3-bound
speaking practice — the grammar reading-only drills miss (〜ている, 〜なきゃ/〜ないと, 〜たい,
volitional 〜よう, 〜ておく, 〜そう…).

Layer docs: module map + dead-ends in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); card/furigana model in
[CARDS.md](CARDS.md); the shared record-and-compare engine in [NEXT_AUDIO_UNIFY.md](NEXT_AUDIO_UNIFY.md).

## What it is (and how it differs from Minna)

- **Anon-readable, account-gated authoring** (as of the unified sentence store, Phase 1). Phrases
  live in the server **sentence store** and are fetched from `GET /v1/sentences?ownerType=selftalk`
  (with a localStorage read-through cache) — built-in phrases are **public** rows everyone (incl.
  anon) can read; a signed-in user also gets their own **private** rows. Unlike みんなの日本語
  (copyright-gated), Self-Talk built-ins are original + model-authored, so anon read is fine.
  **Authoring now requires an account** (your phrases are private store rows, written via
  `POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/sentences`); so does recording (private per-user takes). The bundled
  `data/selftalk.js` is the **seed source** (→ `scripts/seed-sentences.ts`), not read at runtime.
- **Not SRS-graded.** Output reps aren't recognition — there's no Leitner box/schedule. The only
  persisted signal is a lightweight **day streak + "said today"** set.

## Data model

A **phrase** is `{ id, jp, read, mean, topic, thought?, grammar:[…], custom? }`:
- `jp` carries `<ruby>漢字<rt>かな</rt></ruby>` furigana (CARDS.md format; the global `data-furigana`
  flip toggles `<rt>`). `read` is the full kana reading (furigana-off display). **No `accent`** —
  pitch is a per-WORD property and a single drop number is meaningless over a sentence, so phrases
  rely on the furigana + the synth audio's prosody.
- `topic` is one of `SELFTALK_TAXONOMY`'s topic ids; its CATEGORY is **derived** from that registry
  (category → topics). The categories so far: **Daily life** (the 7 time-of-day topics), **Gaming**
  (Minecraft / incremental / The Sims), and **Conversations by register** (with a coworker / friend /
  boyfriend — each topic carries a `register` ∈ `plain`|`polite`|`intimate`, surfaced as a badge in
  the topic view; conversation lines are written *in* that register). Stored as
  `sentence_tag(kind='topic')`, with a legacy `scene`-tag read-fallback for pre-grid rows.
- `thought` (optional) is a **sentence-thought** — a labeled sub-cluster of related lines *within* a
  topic (e.g. Minecraft → "Gathering resources" / "Surviving the night"). The slug is declared in the
  topic's `thoughts: [{id,label}]` registry entry; phrases carrying it cluster under that label in the
  topic view, and any phrase *without* a thought trails under a muted "More" heading. Stored as
  `sentence_tag(kind='thought')`; omitted entirely on flat topics (which render as a single list).
- `grammar` ⊂ `SELFTALK_GRAMMAR` (`te-iru`/`nakya`/`tai`/`volitional`/`te-oku`/`sou`). **Every phrase
  carries ≥1 of these 6 teaching tags** (pinned by the dataset test) — that's the point of Self-Talk,
  so new content is authored to feature one. The furigana↔`read` consistency of every built-in is
  also test-gated (the round-trip over ALL of `SELFTALK`), which catches reading typos on new lines.
- Phrases now live in the **sentence store**: built-ins are public rows (seeded from
  `data/selftalk.js`), **user-authored** phrases (`custom:true`) are private rows
  (`created_by`, `visibility='private'`). The store keeps furigana as structured `[{t,r?}]`
  segments; the client converts via `rubyToSegments`/`segmentsToRuby`/`segmentsToReading`
  (`core/text.js`) and adapts a store sentence → the phrase shape with `sentenceToPhrase`
  (`core/selftalk.js`). The fetched set is cached in `localStorage["jpverbs_selftalk_cache"]`
  (read-through; degrade-don't-break offline). **Invariant:** the phrase `id` is the store's
  `ext_id` (`st-<slug>` / `usr-<uuid>`), preserved verbatim — it's the record-compare itemKey +
  practice key.

**Synced blob** (`localStorage["jpverbs_selftalk"]`, app key `selftalk` — the 5th sync trio):
`{ practice:{ lastDay:'YYYY-MM-DD'|null, streak, doneToday:[id…] } }` — the practice/streak signal
ONLY (per "blobs = per-user signals; store = sentence text"). Pre-store phrases in an old blob are
migrated into the store once on sign-in, then dropped from the blob. Server enum already includes
`selftalk` ([../wk-enhanced-api/src/routes/progress.ts](../wk-enhanced-api/src/routes/progress.ts)).

## Structure (a grid + drill-in)

`#stBody` is a **two-level browse**, not a flat list:

- **Category→topic grid** (`renderGrid`) — the default view. `SELFTALK_TAXONOMY` (`data/selftalk.js`)
  defines categories, each with ordered topics; the pure `topicGrid` (`core/selftalk.js`) buckets the
  live phrases into per-category cells carrying a phrase count + today's said-count, drops empty
  topics/categories, and folds any unregistered `topic` into a trailing **"Other"** cell so content
  can't silently vanish. Clicking a cell drills in.
- **Topic view** (`renderTopic`) — clicking a cell **swaps `#stBody` in place** (it stays the stable
  attach-once record-compare container — drill-in, NOT a modal or stacked accordions): a back button,
  the topic head (+ a `register` badge for the conversation-register topics), then the phrase list
  with the full ▶ / record-and-compare rig. If the topic declares `thoughts`, the pure `groupByThought`
  splits the list into **sentence-thought** sub-clusters (each under a mono heading, loose lines under
  "More"); a flat topic renders one ungrouped list. The today set always renders flat. `stTopic`
  (view-only; `null` = grid) holds the drill state and resets to the grid on tab-leave.
- **Today's focus** — a pinned grid **cell** (no longer a toggle) that drills into a deterministic
  daily rotation (`todaysSet`, seeded by `localDay()` via an FNV-1a hash — stable within a day,
  rotates across days). Because only ONE view renders at a time, each phrase (and its record control)
  still renders exactly once per `(scope,itemKey)` — the **"filter, not a duplicated section"**
  invariant, now preserved by *drilling* rather than stacking sections.
- **Grammar-tier filter** — a cross-cutting chip row (in `#stHead`) over the present grammar tokens;
  a phrase matches if it carries ANY selected token (empty = all). Applies in BOTH views — it narrows
  the grid cells + their counts, and the drilled topic's phrases. View-only (not synced).

## Audio + record-and-compare (reuses the shared engine)

- **Playback:** the ▶ on each phrase calls `playItem({ text: plainText(jp) }, 'selftalk', btn)` —
  the unified player with the **`selftalk`** per-context voice priority (Settings → Voice priority).
  ⌥/⇧-click cycles voices. `plainText` strips ruby to the exact string `/v1/audio/tts` keys on.
- **Record + compare:** Self-Talk feeds the generic engine (`record-compare.js`) a **reserved
  numeric scope** `SELFTALK_SCOPE = 90000` (the engine's opaque partition → the server's `lesson`
  query param; Minna uses 1–50, so they never collide) + the phrase id as the itemKey + a
  **synth-only reference** (`recordControlHtml(SCOPE, id, '', null, false, text, 'selftalk')` — no
  native clip, so ▶ reference resolves to a Siri/Google voice from the phrase text). You get the full
  rig: ▶ you / ▶ reference / →you / both / loop, dual waveform, volume normalization, speed control.
- **Speaking bar** lives in the navbar `#navExtra` slot (`renderNavSpeaking`, built from the engine
  primitives `speakingBarHtml`/`initMicSelector`/`wireSpeakingControls`) — gated on account +
  `RECORD_SUPPORTED`. Per-phrase record controls render only `if (isSpeakingMode())`.

## Practice signal (streak)

Pure helpers in `core/selftalk.js`: `applyPractice` (mark a phrase said on a day — new day → streak
+1 if yesterday, else reset to 1; same day → add to `doneToday`), `practiceStreak` (the displayed
streak — alive if practiced today/yesterday, else 0), `donePhraseIds` (today's set, for the per-card
✓). A phrase is marked practiced either by the **"✓ I said it"** button (works offline/anonymous) or
automatically when you **save a recording** (the engine's `setOnTakeSaved` host hook, filtered to
`SELFTALK_SCOPE`). The streak chip is in the tab head.

## Lifecycle (mic never lingers)

Mirrors Minna: `onSelftalkHidden()` (chrome.js `leaveSelftalk` → main.js) exits speaking mode + clears
the nav bar on tab switch; a `visibilitychange` handler releases the mic on browser-tab hide — **guarded
on `#panel-selftalk` being active** so it doesn't fight Minna's handler (both call the idempotent
`exitSpeakingMode`). The speaking-mode singletons (`speakingMode`/`liveStream`) are shared with Minna —
fine, since only one tab is active at a time.

## Proofread caveat

The built-in phrases + furigana are **model-generated** → worth a grammar/furigana proofread (same
status as `examples.js`/Minna). Fixes are plain-data edits in `data/selftalk.js`. The round-trip
test guarantees furigana↔`read` consistency, but NOT naturalness or register-appropriateness — the
**Gaming** + **Conversations-by-register** content (the P2 starter set) especially wants a native
eye on phrasing and on whether each conversation line sits at the right politeness level. After any
edit, re-run `seed-sentences.ts` to push it to the store (and the NLP re-parse for tap-to-lookup).

## Backlog / ideas

- Pre-generate the Self-Talk phrases into the `generate-tts.ts` corpus (optional operator step;
  first play Google-synths + caches regardless) so the Siri reference is instant.
- A copy-sentence button on phrases (mirror the example-row copy button).
- Per-phrase "favorite" / hide-from-rotation; a larger curated starter set.
